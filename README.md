## Sysmodule and Restarter

We are using [Uncrustify](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify) to lint and formart the codebase in C. You should install it before.
After that you could run it using this command:

```
> sh scripts/sysmodule-lint.sh
```

Warning: Uncrustify is good, but could do mistakes! You should check the differences always when use it. I recommend that you commit your changes before to run it, use `git add -p` and the use `git commit --amend`.
